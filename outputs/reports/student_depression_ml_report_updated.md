# Student Depression Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Comprehensive Analysis Report

## a. Background to the Problem

Depression is a prevalent mental health condition affecting millions of people worldwide, with university students being particularly vulnerable due to various academic, social, and personal pressures. According to the World Health Organization, depression is one of the leading causes of disability globally and contributes significantly to the overall global burden of disease. Among university students, depression can lead to decreased academic performance, social withdrawal, and in severe cases, suicidal ideation.

Early detection and intervention are crucial for effective management of depression. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires, which may be subjective and require professional administration. Machine learning offers a promising approach to develop predictive models that can identify students at risk of depression based on various demographic, academic, and lifestyle factors.

This project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting depression in students. By leveraging patterns in student data, these models can potentially serve as screening tools to identify at-risk individuals who might benefit from further assessment and support.

### ii. Method

#### Data Preprocessing Pipeline

The data preprocessing pipeline consisted of several steps to prepare the raw data for model training:

1. **Missing Value Handling**:
   - Numeric features: Imputed using median values
   - Categorical features: Encoded using Label Encoding

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created composite features to capture interaction effects:
     - Pressure_Score = Academic Pressure + Work Pressure
     - Satisfaction_Score = Study Satisfaction + Job Satisfaction
     - Stress_Index = (Academic Pressure + Work Pressure + Financial Stress) / 3

3. **Data Splitting**:
   - Train-Test Split: 80% training, 20% testing (stratified by target variable)
   - Stratification ensured consistent class distribution in both sets

4. **Class Imbalance Handling**:
   - Applied Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance classes in the training set
   - SMOTE was triggered when minority/majority class ratio was < 0.8

5. **Feature Scaling**:
   - Applied StandardScaler to normalize all features to mean=0, std=1
   - Scaling parameters were learned from training data and applied to test data

#### Model Development

Five different machine learning models were implemented and evaluated, each with distinct characteristics, strengths, and theoretical foundations:

##### 1. **Logistic Regression**

**Description:**
Logistic Regression is a statistical model that uses a logistic function to model the probability of a binary outcome. Despite its name, it's a classification algorithm rather than a regression algorithm.

**How It Works:**
- The model calculates the weighted sum of input features (linear combination)
- This sum is transformed using the sigmoid function to output a probability between 0 and 1
- If the probability is above 0.5, the sample is classified as positive (1), otherwise negative (0)

**Model Parameters:**
- max_iter=1000: Maximum number of iterations for convergence
- random_state=42: Seed for reproducibility

**Strengths:**
- Highly interpretable - coefficients indicate the effect of each feature
- Works well with linearly separable data
- Requires less computational power
- Provides probability estimates

**Limitations:**
- Cannot capture complex non-linear relationships
- May underperform with high-dimensional data

**Visual Representation:**

                        ↓
                  Predicted Class
```

##### 2. **Random Forest**

**Description:**
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes predicted by individual trees.

**How It Works:**
- Creates multiple decision trees using bootstrap samples of the training data
- Each tree is trained on a random subset of features
- For classification, the final prediction is determined by majority voting
- Reduces overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees

**Model Parameters:**
- n_estimators=100: Number of trees in the forest
- random_state=42: Seed for reproducibility

**Strengths:**
- Handles high-dimensional data well
- Captures non-linear relationships
- Provides feature importance measures
- Robust to outliers and noisy data
- Less prone to overfitting than single decision trees

**Limitations:**
- Less interpretable than single decision trees or linear models
- Computationally intensive for large datasets
- May still overfit on noisy datasets

**Visual Representation:**
```

          Final Prediction
```

##### 3. **Gradient Boosting**

**Description:**
Gradient Boosting is a sequential ensemble method that builds trees one at a time, where each new tree corrects the errors made by the previous ones.

**How It Works:**
- Starts with a simple model (usually a decision tree with limited depth)
- Iteratively adds new trees that predict the residuals (errors) of the previous trees
- Each new tree focuses on the samples that were misclassified by previous trees
- Combines all trees with weighted voting to make the final prediction

**Model Parameters:**
- n_estimators=100: Number of boosting stages (trees)
- random_state=42: Seed for reproducibility

**Strengths:**
- Often achieves higher accuracy than Random Forest
- Handles different types of data and relationships
- Feature importance measures are provided
- Sequential learning focuses on hard-to-classify cases

**Limitations:**
- More prone to overfitting than Random Forest
- Requires careful tuning of learning rate and tree depth
- Training is sequential and cannot be easily parallelized
- Sensitive to noisy data and outliers

##### 4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

**Description:**
SVM is a discriminative classifier that finds an optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between different classes. For non-linear boundaries, it uses the "kernel trick" to transform the data into a higher-dimensional space.

**How It Works:**
- Maps input data to a high-dimensional feature space
- Finds the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes
- Support vectors are the data points closest to the hyperplane
- Uses kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF) to handle non-linear relationships

**Model Parameters:**
- probability=True: Enables probability estimates (required for ROC-AUC calculation)
- random_state=42: Seed for reproducibility
- Default RBF kernel: Radial Basis Function kernel for non-linear classification

**Strengths:**
- Effective in high-dimensional spaces
- Memory efficient as it uses only a subset of training points (support vectors)
- Versatile through different kernel functions
- Works well when classes are separable

**Limitations:**
- Doesn't scale well to large datasets
- Sensitive to choice of kernel and regularization parameter
- Less transparent in how decisions are made
- Probability estimates are computationally expensive

##### 5. **Neural Network (Multi-Layer Perceptron)**

**Description:**
MLP is a class of feedforward artificial neural network that consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. Each node uses a nonlinear activation function.

**How It Works:**
- Information flows from input layer through hidden layers to output layer
- Each connection between neurons has a weight that is adjusted during training
- Activation functions introduce non-linearity
- Uses backpropagation to update weights based on prediction error
- For binary classification, the output neuron uses sigmoid activation

**Model Parameters:**
- hidden_layer_sizes=(100, 50): Two hidden layers with 100 and 50 neurons respectively
- max_iter=1000: Maximum number of iterations for training
- random_state=42: Seed for reproducibility

**Strengths:**
- Can model complex non-linear relationships
- Adaptable to various types of data
- Capable of feature learning (automatic feature extraction)
- Scales well with amount of data

**Limitations:**
- Requires more data to perform well
- Computationally intensive
- Prone to overfitting without regularization
- "Black box" nature makes interpretation difficult
- Sensitive to feature scaling

**Visual Representation:**
```
    Input Layer       Hidden Layers       Output Layer
                                        
       x₁ ──┐      ┌─── h₁₁ ───┐       ┌───┐

             │      │           │       │   │    (Depression)

             │                           
       xₙ ──┘      ┌─── h₂₁ ───┐        
                    │           │        
                    │─── h₂₂ ───┤        
                    │           │        
                    │─── ...    │        
                    │           │        
                    └─── h₂ₙ ───┘        
```

**Hyperparameter Tuning**:
For the Random Forest model, grid search cross-validation was implemented to find optimal hyperparameters:
- n_estimators: [50, 100, 200] - Number of trees in the forest
- max_depth: [10, 20, None] - Maximum depth of each tree
- min_samples_split: [2, 5, 10] - Minimum samples required to split a node

This process systematically evaluates all possible combinations of these parameters, using 5-fold cross-validation to find the combination that yields the best performance.

#### Evaluation Metrics

Model performance was evaluated using multiple metrics to provide a comprehensive assessment:

1. **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions
   - Formula: (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
   - Range: 0 to 1 (higher is better)
   - Interpretation: Overall correctness of the model
   - Limitation: Can be misleading for imbalanced datasets

2. **Precision**: Proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct
   - Formula: TP / (TP + FP)
   - Range: 0 to 1 (higher is better)
   - Interpretation: How many identified depression cases were actual depression cases
   - Importance: Critical when false positives have high consequences

3. **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly
   - Formula: TP / (TP + FN)
   - Range: 0 to 1 (higher is better)
   - Interpretation: How many actual depression cases were correctly identified
   - Importance: Critical for early intervention to not miss actual cases

4. **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
   - Formula: 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
   - Range: 0 to 1 (higher is better)
   - Interpretation: Balance between precision and recall
   - Usage: Useful when seeking a balance between precision and recall

5. **ROC-AUC**: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve
   - Range: 0.5 to 1 (0.5 = random, 1 = perfect)
   - Interpretation: Probability that the model ranks a random positive example higher than a random negative example
   - Advantage: Insensitive to class imbalance, evaluates model across all thresholds

Where:
- TP = True Positives (correctly identified depression cases)
- TN = True Negatives (correctly identified non-depression cases)
- FP = False Positives (incorrectly identified as depression)
- FN = False Negatives (incorrectly identified as non-depression)

Additionally, 5-fold cross-validation was performed to ensure robustness of the results. The ROC-AUC score was used as the primary metric for model comparison and selection due to its insensitivity to class imbalance and comprehensive evaluation across different classification thresholds.

```

From this matrix, we can calculate:
- True Positives (TP): 2,846
- True Negatives (TN): 1,850
- False Positives (FP): 463
- False Negatives (FN): 422

These values translate to the performance metrics:
- Accuracy: (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) = (2,846 + 1,850) / (2,846 + 1,850 + 463 + 422) = 0.843
- Precision: TP / (TP + FP) = 2,846 / (2,846 + 463) = 0.860
- Recall: TP / (TP + FN) = 2,846 / (2,846 + 422) = 0.871
- F1-Score: 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * (0.860 * 0.871) / (0.860 + 0.871) = 0.865

### ii. Discussion

#### Model Performance Assessment

The Gradient Boosting model demonstrated the best overall performance with an ROC-AUC score of 0.919 and an accuracy of 84.3%. This indicates strong predictive capability for identifying students at risk of depression. The high recall value (0.871) is particularly important in this context, as it represents the model's ability to correctly identify students with depression (minimizing false negatives), which is crucial for early intervention.

All models performed reasonably well, with ROC-AUC scores ranging from 0.867 to 0.919, suggesting that machine learning approaches can effectively detect patterns associated with depression in student data. The consistent performance across different algorithms indicates robust signal in the dataset's features.

**Comparative Analysis of Models:**

1. **Gradient Boosting**: Achieved the highest performance across all metrics. Its sequential learning approach, which focuses on correcting errors from previous trees, worked particularly well for this classification task. The ability to capture complex interactions between features likely contributed to its success.

2. **Logistic Regression**: Performed surprisingly well with an ROC-AUC of 0.917, nearly matching Gradient Boosting. This suggests that many relationships in the data have strong linear components that can be effectively captured by simpler models.

3. **Random Forest**: Performed third-best with an ROC-AUC of 0.911. Its ensemble approach of multiple independent trees provided good generalization and resistance to overfitting. The model also provided valuable feature importance measures.

4. **SVM**: Showed solid performance with an ROC-AUC of 0.904. The RBF kernel effectively captured non-linear relationships in the data. While not the top performer, its margin-based approach provided good separation between classes.

5. **Neural Network**: Despite its theoretical capacity to model complex relationships, the MLP model (ROC-AUC 0.867) didn't perform as well as the other models. This could be due to the limited dataset size relative to what neural networks typically require for optimal performance.

The superior performance of tree-based ensemble methods (Gradient Boosting and Random Forest) suggests that the depression prediction task benefits from models that can:
1. Capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features
2. Handle mixed data types effectively
3. Manage noisy or irrelevant features
4. Learn complex decision boundaries

The strong performance of Logistic Regression is notable and suggests that while the relationships are complex, they have significant linear components that can be effectively modeled.

#### Feature Importance Insights

The feature importance analysis from the Random Forest model reveals several key insights:

1. **Mental Health Indicators**: Suicidal thoughts emerged as the strongest predictor, which aligns with clinical understanding of depression. This suggests that screening for suicidal ideation should be a priority in student mental health programs.

2. **Stress Factors**: The engineered Stress_Index feature and individual stress measures (Academic Pressure, Work Pressure) showed high importance, highlighting the significant role of stress in student depression.

3. **Socioeconomic Factors**: Financial stress ranked high in predictive power, emphasizing the link between economic hardship and mental health among students.

4. **Health Behaviors**: Sleep duration was among the top predictors, reinforcing the well-established connection between sleep quality and mental health.

5. **Feature Engineering Value**: The engineered features (Stress_Index, Pressure_Score) ranked highly, demonstrating the value of domain knowledge in feature creation.

This hierarchical importance suggests a potential screening approach where the most predictive factors could be assessed first in a tiered screening system. The model confirms many clinical observations about depression risk factors while quantifying their relative importance in the student population.

#### Limitations and Future Directions

While the models show promising results, several limitations should be acknowledged:

1. **Self-reported Data**: The dataset relies on self-reported measures, which may be subject to reporting biases, social desirability effects, and recall errors.

2. **Binary Classification**: Depression is treated as a binary outcome, whereas in reality, it exists on a spectrum of severity. Future models could approach this as a multi-class or regression problem.

3. **Temporal Dynamics**: The cross-sectional nature of the data doesn't capture how depression risk factors evolve over time. Longitudinal data would provide insights into the development and progression of depression.

4. **Generalizability**: The models may not generalize well to different student populations or cultural contexts without additional validation and potentially retraining.

5. **Causal Relationships**: Machine learning models identify correlations but cannot establish causality between features and depression.

Future work could address these limitations by:

1. Incorporating longitudinal data to track changes in depression risk over time
2. Integrating objective measures (e.g., physiological data, academic performance records, social media activity patterns)
3. Developing multi-class models to predict depression severity levels
4. Exploring more sophisticated ensemble methods and deep learning approaches with larger datasets
5. Testing the models across diverse student populations and cultural contexts
6. Combining machine learning predictions with clinical expertise in a human-in-the-loop system

#### Practical Applications

The developed models have potential applications in educational settings:

1. **Early Screening Tool**: Universities could implement these models as part of student wellness programs to identify at-risk individuals. The hierarchical importance of features could inform a tiered screening approach.

2. **Targeted Interventions**: By understanding the most predictive factors, institutions can develop targeted support programs addressing specific risk factors:
   - Financial support programs for students experiencing economic hardship
   - Stress management workshops focusing on academic and work pressures
   - Sleep hygiene education and resources
   - Enhanced mental health services with particular attention to suicidal ideation

3. **Resource Allocation**: Mental health resources could be more efficiently allocated based on predicted risk profiles, ensuring that limited resources reach those most in need.

4. **Anonymous Self-Assessment**: Students could use a simplified version of the model for self-assessment and guidance toward appropriate resources, potentially reducing stigma associated with seeking help.

5. **Population-Level Monitoring**: Aggregated, anonymized predictions could help institutions monitor overall mental health trends and evaluate the impact of interventions at the population level.

Implementation of these applications would require careful ethical considerations, including:
- Ensuring privacy and confidentiality of student data
- Avoiding stigmatization of identified at-risk students
- Providing appropriate follow-up resources for all positive screenings
- Maintaining human oversight and clinical judgment in conjunction with algorithmic predictions

In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning approaches for predicting depression in students. The Gradient Boosting model, in particular, shows promise as a screening tool to identify students who might benefit from mental health support. The identified predictive factors align with clinical understanding of depression risk and provide actionable insights for prevention and intervention strategies in educational settings.
